# RBAC-UI--VRV-Security

# Role Management System

A web-based role management system built with React and Node.js. This application allows administrators to manage user roles, add new roles, and delete existing ones. The roles are stored and fetched from a backend API (Node.js + Express) and are displayed in a table with options for modification.

## Features
- View a list of all user roles.
- Add new roles to the system.
- Delete roles from the system.
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (or any database you're using)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS (or Material UI, Bootstrap if used)
- **Environment**: Development environment setup with Node.js, React, and npm/yarn.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/role-management.git
cd role-management

2. Install backend dependencies:
Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install

3. Set up the backend environment:
Create a .env file for your backend configuration (e.g., database connection URL).
Ensure your backend server runs on http://localhost:5000.

4. Install frontend dependencies:
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install

5. Run the development server:
For the backend:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Your backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

For the frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Your frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

6. Access the application:
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the Role Management System.
